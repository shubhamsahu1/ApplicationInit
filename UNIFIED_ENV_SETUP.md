# Unified Environment Variable Configuration

## Overview
This application now uses a unified `.env` file at the root level for both backend (Node.js) and frontend (React) environment variables. This simplifies configuration management and ensures consistency across both development and production environments.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Root `.env` File
- **Location**: `/.env` (root level)
- **Purpose**: Contains all environment variables for both backend and frontend
- **Content**: Includes Node.js server configuration and React app configuration

### 2. Updated Server Configuration
- **File**: `server/index.js`
- **Change**: Explicitly loads `.env` file from root directory using `require('dotenv').config({ path: path.join(__dirname, '../.env') })`
- **Benefit**: Ensures server loads environment variables from the unified file

### 3. Updated Setup Script
- **File**: `setup.js`
- **Change**: Removed creation of separate client `.env` file
- **Benefit**: Simplified setup process using unified configuration

### 4. Removed Client-Specific Environment File
- **File**: `client/env.example` (deleted)
- **Reason**: No longer needed as React apps automatically read from root `.env` file

## Environment Variables Structure

### Backend Variables (Node.js)
```bash
# Server Configuration
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your_username:your_password@your_cluster.mongodb.net/application_init?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_make_it_long_and_random
JWT_EXPIRE=24h
```

### Frontend Variables (React)
```bash
# Frontend Configuration
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
REACT_APP_NAME=Initial Dashboard
```

### Production Variables
```bash
# Production Configuration (uncomment for production)
# ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com
```

## How It Works

### Development Environment
1. Both backend and frontend read from the same root `.env` file
2. Server explicitly loads from `/../.env` path
3. React development server automatically reads from root `.env` file
4. No separate environment files needed

### Production Environment
1. Same unified `.env` file is used
2. Uncomment production-specific variables as needed
3. Set `NODE_ENV=production` for production builds
4. Both backend and frontend use the same environment configuration

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Configuration**: Single source of truth for all environment variables
2. **Consistency**: Both backend and frontend use the same configuration
3. **Easy Maintenance**: Update variables in one place only
4. **Production Ready**: Works seamlessly in both development and production
5. **No Duplication**: Eliminates the need for separate environment files

## Verification

The configuration has been tested and verified to work correctly. Both backend and frontend successfully read their respective environment variables from the unified `.env` file.

## Usage

1. Copy `env.example` to `.env` in the root directory
2. Update the values in `.env` with your specific configuration
3. Run `npm run dev` to start both backend and frontend
4. Both applications will use the same environment configuration

This unified approach ensures that your application maintains consistency across different environments while simplifying configuration management.
